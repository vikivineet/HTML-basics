    <p><b>India</b> (Hindi: <i>Bhārat</i>), officially the<b>Republic of India</b> (Hindi: <i>Bhārat Gaṇarājya</i>),[23]
        is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area,
        and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
        southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with <b>Pakistan</b> to the west;[f]
        <b>China, Nepal</b>, and <b>Bhutan</b> to the north; and <b>Bangladesh</b> and <b>Myanmar</b> to the east. In
        the Indian Ocean, <b>India</b> is in the vicinity of <b>Sri Lanka</b> and <b>the Maldives</b>; its Andaman and
        Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with <b>Thailand</b>, <b>Myanmar</b> and <b>Indonesia</b>.

    <P>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] Their long
        occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
        second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western
        margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the
        third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into
        India from the northwest,[27] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in
        India.[28][disputed – discuss] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western
        regions.[29] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[30] and Buddhism and
        Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[31] Early political consolidations gave rise
        to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[32] Their collective era was suffused with
        wide-ranging creativity,[33] but also marked by the declining status of women,[34] and the incorporation of
        untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][35] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
        Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.<sup><a

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical
        Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively
        from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province
        of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus
        river and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[61][62] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians
        as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus".[63]</p>
    <p>The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (About this soundlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry
        and the Constitution of India,[64][65] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of
        the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to a region of the Gangetic Valley,[66][67] Bharat
        gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[64][68]</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Modern India</h3>
    <p>Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of
        Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern
        state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and
        the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced
        not long after their introduction in Europe.[134][135][136][137] However, disaffection with the company also
        grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions,
        including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners
        and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of
        Company rule.[138][139] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East
        India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and
        a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed
        gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[140][141] In the decades following, public life gradually
        emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.</p>
    <p>The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked
        by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[146] There was an
        increase in the number of large-scale famines,[147] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne
        by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[148] There were also salutaryF
        effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for
        internal consumption.[149] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[150] notably reduced the cost of
        moving goods,[150] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.</p>

                    <p><b>Bihar</b> (/bɪˈhɑːr/; Hindi pronunciation: [bɪˈɦaːr] (About this soundlisten)) is a state in
                        eastern
                        India. It is the third-largest state by population and twelfth-largest by territory, with an
                        area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi). It is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the
                        north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and with Jharkhand to the south. The Bihar
                        plain is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east.[11] Three main cultural
                        regions converge in the state: Magadh, Mithila, and Bhojpur.[12] Bihar is also the world's
                        third-most populous subnational entity.F</p>
