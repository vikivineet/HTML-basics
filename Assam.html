    <h1>Assam</h1>
    <p><b>Assam</b> (/əˈsæm, æˈsæm/,[10][11] Assamese: [ˈɔxɔm] (About this soundlisten)) is a state in northeastern
        India,

        south of the eastern Himalayas along the Brahmaputra and Barak River valleys. Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2
        (30,285 sq mi). The state is bordered by Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh to the north; Nagaland and Manipur to the
        east; Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Bangladesh to the south; and West Bengal to the west via the Siliguri
        Corridor, a 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India. It is also
        one of the world's most populous subdivisions. Assamese is the official and most commonly spoken language of the
        state, followed by Bengali, which is official in the Barak Valley and Bodo which is official in Bodoland
        Territorial Region.

        Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The state was the first site for oil drilling in Asia.[12] Assam is
        home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy hog, tiger and various
        species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese
        economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park, which are World
        Heritage Sites. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is famed for its feral horses. Sal tree forests are found in the
        state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most
        parts of India; this rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with
        a hydro-geomorphic environment.</p>
